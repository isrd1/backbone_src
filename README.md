backbone_sls: Student Record System
===================================

Using Backbone, with RequireJS, for a modular app pulling data from an Object Oriented set of php scripts. Another teaching and learning project this one uses Backbone with requireJS for a modular approach. With a set of php scripts to return json data from a database.

To get the code working you should read and alter server/resources/setEnv.php and also server/config/config.xml.php both files are commented to tell you how to alter them.

There is sql script in 'server/' which you can import into your database, or there is a sqlite database which might be the easiest to use.  Note that file would need public read and perhaps write access to work.
